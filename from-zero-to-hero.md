# Programing - From ZERO to HERO!

## What is PROGRAMING?
It's just the way we command the computer to do something, generaly for solve some problems.

## What is a PROGRAMING LANGUAGE?
It's the set of symbols, words and grammar rules that allow us to write PROGRAMS and give insturctions to the computer.

## What KINDS of PROGRAMING LANGUAGES are there?
There are many types of PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, but generaly they're oriented to solve an specific problem, such as JavaScript
or PHP. There're also general porpouse languages, like C/C++ or Java.

## Is there a PROGRAMING LANGUAGE better than the rest?
No, but yes. Let me explain it. It's like the languages in real life. There's a bunch of things you can easily express into al language, for hinstance English, but not in other, like the Guarani, and the Guarani is not a worse language for that. Of course, there are some languages that are more popular than the rest, but not for that are better.

## What is a PROGRAM?
It's just a set of instructions to solve a problem. Normaly, they can be executed by a computer.

## How does a COMPUTER works internaly?
There are many componenets, but abstracting everything, we can say that principaly, there are a MEMORY, which allows the PROCESSATOR (CPU) READ a program and EXECUTE it; a PROCESSATOR or CPU, that EXECUTES a PROGRAM; a HARD DISK or HDD, which stores some DATA permanently unlike the MEMORY and at last a set of INPUT and OUTPUT devices, which could be KEYBOARDS, SCREENS, SPEAKERS, MICE, TOUCHPADS, etc, and allow us to input DATA and recive INFORMATION. All the components are interconnected through a MOTHERBOARD, which is covered by a CASE. 

## What are SOFTWARE and HARDWARE?
The physical components of a COMPUTER, like memories, cpu's, speakers, etc, are called HARDWARE. The logical ones, like the programs, are the SOFTWARE.

## The LOGIC behind PROGRAMING:
There are some logical structures that are basic to solve any kind of problems. The most of this structures and techniques we know, the most problems we can solve.
Some of them are:
- Blocks
- Conditionals
- Loops

Which are divided into more cathegories.
Also, there're some common data structures, that allow us to represent some specific phenom. Some of them are:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Lists
- Vectors
- Matrixes
- Tables
- Graphs
- Trees
- Sets

And at last, the data can have a datatype, which makes easier to work with it. Some of them are:
- Integer numbers
- Float numbers (until 3 digits after the decimal point)
- Double Float or Real numbers (until 6 or more digits after the decimal point)
- Booleans (can only be true or false)
- Characters (could be any of the 256 ASCII characters)
- Strings or Texts (an "array" of characters that can contain an etrie text)
- Undefined (for data that is not defined)
- Void (for data that is defined but has not an specific datatype)

With this base, let's try to explain the logical structures.

## Logical Structures:
Let's see the blocks first. We can say somebody to do something or many things in an specific order. This is a BLOCK of instructions and a computer always will follow it STEP BY STEP, SECUENTIALY, IN ORDER.
